                orm a new administration. It was the evident will of Parliament and the nation that this should be
                conceived on the broadest possible basis and that it should include all parties. I have already
                completed
                the
                most important part of this task. A war cabinet has been formed of five members, representing, with the
                Labor,
                Opposition and Liberals, the unity of the nation. It was necessary that this should be done in one
                single
                day on

                account of the extreme urgency and rigor of events. Other key positions were filled yesterday. I am
                submitting a
                further list to the King tonight. I hope to complete the appointment of principal Ministers during
                tomorrow.
                The
                appointment of other Ministers usually takes a little longer. I trust when Parliament meets again this
                part
                of
                my task will be completed and that the administration will be complete in all respects. I considered it
                in
                the
                public interest to suggest to the Speaker that the House should be summoned today. At the end of today's
                proceedings, the adjournment of the House will be proposed until May 2l with provision for earlier meeting if need be. Business for that will be notified to M. P. 's at the earliest opportunity.  I now invite the House by a resolution to record its approval of the steps taken and declare its confidence in the new government. The resolution   
                That this House welcomes the formation of a govern
